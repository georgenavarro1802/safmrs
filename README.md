# SAFMR Lookup and ROI Calculator

This is a simple Python project that provides an interface for looking up Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMR) by ZIP code and calculating the Return on Investment (ROI) for rental properties. It uses Flask for the web application backend and Bootstrap 5 for a responsive user interface.

## Features
- **SAFMR Lookup**: Enter a ZIP code to get the SAFMR details for different bedroom types (Studio, 1 Bed, 2 Bed, etc.).
- **ROI Calculator**: Calculate the monthly and annual cash flow, as well as the ROI based on selected rent, property price, interest rate, and other financial inputs.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Flask
- Pandas
- Bootstrap 5 (included via CDN in HTML)

### Installation and Running Locally
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd safmr_app
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5002`.

## Creating an Executable
To create an executable file for distribution, you can use PyInstaller:

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "SAFMR_2025.csv:." --add-data "templates/index.html:templates" app.py
```

This command will generate a single executable file in the `dist/` directory, including both the CSV data and the HTML template.

## Usage
- **Run the Executable**: Simply execute the `.exe` file generated by PyInstaller. The application will start a server that can be accessed through a browser.
- **Enter ZIP Code**: Input the ZIP code to get SAFMR data and see rent estimates for different bedroom types.
- **Calculate ROI**: Use the ROI calculator by filling in the details like property price, interest rate, etc., and click on the rent value to perform the calculations.

## Notes
- This project is meant for local usage only. If you wish to make it available over the internet, consider adding authentication and securing the endpoints.
- The Flask development server is used here, which is not suitable for production. For a production setup, use a WSGI server like Gunicorn.
